Objective: To gain experience in writing recursive functions

Write a menu-driven program with the following options
• to call a recursive function, which raises a number to the power(whole number)
    - must work for negative as well as positive values.  
    - ask a user for the values of the base and the power
• to call a recursive function, that produce the sum of the squares for the first n terms of the series (1*1)+(2*2)+ 
    (3*3)+…..(n*n)-[staring with 11
    - output sample: 1+(2*2)+(3*3)= 14; output to be produced by the recursive function 
    - positive numbers only
    - ask a user for the number of terms
• to call a recursive function to add the first n terms of the series (n*n)+...+(3*3)+(2*2)+(1*1) [ starting with n]
    - output sample (3*3)+(2*2) +1 = 14; output to be produced by the recursive function o positive numbers only
    - ask a user for the number of terms
• to quit

Notes:
• Ask a user for the values of n and x
• Validate all user inbuts
• User should be able to run menu as many times as user wants
• include your test data as comments in main
• submit the hard copy upon approval
• include your name and lab # as a comment
