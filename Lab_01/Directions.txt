Write a modularized, menu-driven program to read a file with the unknown number of records.
• The input file has an unknown number of records of inventory items (may be empty); one record per line in the 
    following order: item ID, item name (one word), quantity on hand, and a price
• All fields in the input file are separated by a tab ('\t') or a blank ( up to you)
• All items are unique
• Item Id and name do not require error checking
  - Create a menu (use a switch statement) which allows to 
  - print the inventory unsorted
  - print the inventory sorted in ascending order; you should allow a user sort by any field: item ID, item name 
      (one word), quantity on hand, or price. Write one function, that can sort by any field using array of pointers. 
      Do not copy and paste sort code five times into the same function. Bubble sort is the easiest to modify.
  - search for an item by ID or name; a user should be able to enter the name of the item using any case, (for 
      example, sTRolleR). You may wish to store items in all lower/upper case to expedite the search. 
  - print a report with the following details
      • number of unique items in the inventor
      • the total worth of the inventory and the total count of all items in the inventory
  - quit the program
• A user should be able to run many as many times as a user wants
• Use arrav of structs if vou do not know how to write classes vet
• Thoroughly test your program. Your grade partially depends on the quality of your test data.
• This a and all other programs in this course must comply with the Guidelines and Standards posted under Resources
• Clearlv label the output
