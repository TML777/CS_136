Write a menu-driven program to handle the flow of widgets into and out of a warehouse.
• The warehouse will have numerous deliveries of new widgets and orders for widgets
• The widgets in a filled order are billed at a profit of 50 percent over their cost
• Each delivery of new widgets may have a different cost associated with it
• The accountants for the firm have instituted a last-in, first-out system for filling orders 
    - the newest widgets are the first ones sent out to fill an order and the most recent orders are filled first 
    - partial shipments allowed
        • 10 widgets were ordered and warehouse has only 4 available, ship 4, the remainder 6 will be shipped later
• Assign unique numbers to each order and each delivery
• This function of inventory can be represented using two stacks: orders-to-be-filled and widgets-on-hand. When 
    delivery of new widgets is received, any unfilled orders (on the orders-to-be-filled stack) are processed and 
    filled. After all orders are filled, if there are widgets remaining in the new delivery, a new element is pushed onto 
    the widgets-on- hand stack. When an order for new widgets is received, one or more objects are popped from 
    the widgets-on-hand stack until the order has been filled.
• If the order is completely filled and there are widgets left over in the last object popped, a modified object with 
    the quantity updated is pushed onto the widgets-on-hand stack.
• If the order is not completely filled, the order is pushed onto the orders-to-be-filled stack with an updated
    quantity of widgets to be sent out later.
• After an order is fully or a partially filled display the following in the format shown below:
    - order number
    - quantity ordered
    - quantity shipped
    - price per widget and the total cost for all widgets in the order 
    - indicate whether there are any widgets remaining to be sent out at a later time.
• After delivery is processed, display information about each order that was filled with this delivery.
• Keep track of the number of widgets in stock and the number of widgets shipped.
• Make sure each function definition is preceded by a description, post/preconditions
• Create menu options to display the details of the inventory on hand ( delivery stack) and the details of the 
    outstanding orders (shipment/order stack)
• You mav implement the stack as an arrav or a linked list
• Well format the output: all numbers should be right-aligned; see the sample below
• Create a test plan ( hand-written or typed); the test plan has to be approved for the instructor before you can 
    submit the lab.
