Implement Hot Potato game

A group of people, numbered 1 to N, are sitting in a circle. Starting at person 1, a hot potato is passed.
After X passes, the person holding the hot potato is eliminated, the circle closes ranks, and the game continues 
with the person who was sitting after the eliminated person picking up the hot potato. The last remaining person 
wins.
For example:
• if X = 0 and N = 5. plavers are eliminated in order, and plaver 5 wins
• If X = 1 and N = 5, the order of elimination is 2, 4, 1, 5.

Write a program for general values of X and N.
• Ask a user for number of people and number of passes
• To speed up input, debugging, store names of the people in a file.
• Output number and the name of a person being eliminated
• Output number and the name of the winner
• Allow user to play the game as many times as user wants
• Make sure each function has a description, post and pre conditions
